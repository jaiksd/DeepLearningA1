For Question 1, I have provided Question_1.ipynb.
For Question 2, I have provided Question_2.ipynb.
For Question_3 upto Question_10 i have provided the DL_Assign_1 code.
This DL_Assign_1 code contains solutions for all the Questions from 1 to 10
train.py is the training code that is used to train the model by taking arguments from the command line.
NOTE: The DL_Assignment_1 was previously uploaded by me then I have uploaded DL_Assign_1, which is the final code
      Run all the codes from the first cell and go cell by cell till the last cell, all the imports are in the first cell.
  
Description:
I have implemented FeedForwardNeuralNetwork with class and objects which is very flexible and can adapt to new added functions.
It contains 784 neurons in the input layer and 10 neurons in the output layer corresponding to 10 class of the dataset.
It is a complete neural network which predicts the class of the test data with high accuracy after training it with train data.


Note:
Please follow all the steps that is run the cell code from top cell then go down one by one.
